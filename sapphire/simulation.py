"""Provides a PDE-governed Simulation class using Firedrake.

Simulations proceed forward in time by solving 
a sequence of Initial Boundary Values Problems (IBVP's).

Using the Firedrake framework, 
the PDE's are discretized in space with Finite Elements (FE).

Furthermore, the symbolic capabilities of Firedrake are used to 
automatically implement backward difference formula (BDF) time 
discretizations and to automatically linearize nonlinear problems 
with Newton's method.

Nonlinear and linear solvers are provided by PETSc
and are accessed via the Firedrake interface.

This module imports `firedrake` as `fe` and its documentation writes
`fe` instead of `firedrake`.

        Instantiating this class requires enough information to fully 
        specify the FE spatial discretization, weak form residual,
        boundary conditions, and initial values. All of these required
        arguments are Firedrake objects used according to Firedrake
        conventions.
        
        Backward Difference Formula time discretizations are
        automatically implemented. To use a different time
        discretization, inherit this class and redefine 
        `time_discrete_terms`.
        
        Args:
            mesh (fe.Mesh): The mesh for spatial discretization.
                The spatial degrees of freedom are determined by
                this mesh and the chosen finite element.
            element (fe.FiniteElement or fe.MixedElement):
                The finite element for spatial discretization.
                Firedrake provides a large suite of finite elements.
            weak_form_residual (fe.Form): The weak form residual
                containing the PDE's which govern the simulation.
                The form is defined symbolically using the 
                Unified Form Language (UFL) via Firedrake.
            dirichlet_boundary_conditions (list of fe.DirichletBC):
                The IBVP Dirichlet boundary conditions.
            initial_values (fe.Function): The IBVP initial values
                expressed as a Firedrake `Function`.
                These are the initial values for the first time step.
                For higher order time discretizations, the values are 
                copied backward in time.
                As a simulation proceeds forward in time, using `run`,
                the latest solution(s) will be used as initial values. 
            quadrature_degree (int): The quadrature degree used for
                numerical integration.
                Defaults to `None`, in which case Firedrake will 
                automatically choose a suitable quadrature degree.
            time_stencil_size (int): The number of solutions at 
                discrete times used for approximating time derivatives.
                This also determines the number of stored solutions.
                Must be greater than zero.
                Defaults to 2. Set to 1 for steady state problems.
                Increase for higher-order time accuracy.
            timestep_size (float): The size of discrete time steps.
                Defaults to 1.
                Higher order time discretizations are assumed to use
                a constant time step size.
                Supporting accurate second-order or higher time
                discretizations with variable time step sizes,
                redefine `time_discrete_terms` and compute the
                time step sizes from the solution times.
            initial_time (float): The initial time.
                Defaults to 0.
            solver_parameters (dict): The solver parameters dictionary
                which Firedrake uses to configure PETSc.
            output_directory_path (str): String that will be converted
                to a Path where output files will be written.
                Defaults to "output/".)
            solution_name (str): Overrides the default name that 
                Firedrake otherwise gives the solution Function.
